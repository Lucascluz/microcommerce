## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When deploying MicroCommerce:

#### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms
- Use proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Enable audit logging for security events
- Regularly rotate credentials and API keys

#### 🌐 Network Security
```yaml
# Example: Network Policy for production
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: microcommerce-netpol
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: microcommerce
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: allowed-namespace
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
```

#### 🗂️ Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Use Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- Follow data retention policies

#### 🔄 Updates & Patches
- Keep all components updated to latest versions
- Subscribe to security advisories
- Implement automated security scanning
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities

### For Developers

When contributing to MicroCommerce:

#### 🔍 Secure Coding Practices
```go
// Example: Input validation
func ValidatePaymentAmount(amount float64) error {
    if amount <= 0 {
        return errors.New("amount must be positive")
    }
    if amount > 1000000 { // Max amount check
        return errors.New("amount exceeds maximum limit")
    }
    return nil
}

// Example: Secure password handling
func HashPassword(password string) (string, error) {
    // Use bcrypt or similar secure hashing
    return bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(password), bcrypt.DefaultCost)
}
```

#### 🧪 Security Testing
- Run security linters (gosec, etc.)
- Perform dependency vulnerability scanning
- Implement security unit tests
- Use static analysis tools

#### 📝 Code Review
- Review all code changes for security implications
- Pay special attention to authentication and authorization code
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding
- Check for information disclosure vulnerabilities

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Security Status

**⚠️ Development Phase Security Notice:**
The current v1.0.0 release is intended for development and evaluation purposes. It includes basic security measures but is not yet production-ready from a security perspective.

### Current Limitations

1. **No Authentication**: Services currently have no authentication
2. **No Authorization**: No access control mechanisms implemented
3. **Plain Text Communication**: Internal service communication is unencrypted
4. **No Input Validation**: Limited input validation and sanitization
5. **No Audit Logging**: Security events are not logged

### Planned Security Enhancements

#### v1.1.0 Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- Basic RBAC implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security headers implementation

#### v1.2.0 Security Features
- TLS/HTTPS enforcement
- Advanced authorization policies
- Security audit logging
- Vulnerability scanning integration

#### v1.3.0 Security Features
- Service mesh with mTLS (Istio)
- Advanced threat detection
- Compliance frameworks support
- Security automation and monitoring

govulncheck ./...

# Docker image scanning
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  aquasec/trivy fs --security-checks vuln /workspace
```

### Runtime Security
```yaml
# Example: Falco rules for runtime security
- rule: Unexpected outbound connection
  desc: Detect unexpected outbound connections from microservices
  condition: >
    (spawned_process and container and
     proc.name != "curl" and proc.name != "wget" and
     fd.type in (ipv4, ipv6) and fd.direction = outbound)
  output: >
    Unexpected outbound connection
    (command=%proc.cmdline connection=%fd.name container=%container.name)
  priority: WARNING
```
